## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate historic weather data on the island of Oahu and make a determination whether it would be an indication of success to open a surfboard and ice cream shop. 

## Results
From the analysis, it was determined that:
	The minimum temperature in June was 64 and the minimum temperature in December was 56
	The maximum temperature in June was 85 and the maximum temperature in December was 83
	The mean temperature in June was 75 and the mean temperature in December was 71

## Summary
The results show that there is not a huge temperature difference between the two months of the year. The mean temperature difference between the two months was only 4 degrees with it being a little cooler on average in December. These results would indicate that the shop would likely be consistent in sales throughout the year based on temperature, however it might be in the shops best interest to evaluate the weather further. A couple other analyses to perform would be to determine the precipitation amounts and differences between the two months, as well as look into the other months (maybe March and September) to get a quarterly insight of the weather.
